Here's a sample `README.md` file template you can use for your GitHub project. It explains the dynamic memory allocation using a doubly linked list and the operations on a CSV file, based on the details you've provided. You can modify it as needed.

# CSV Linked List Operations with Dynamic Memory Allocation

This project demonstrates the use of dynamic memory allocation to create and manipulate a doubly linked list from a CSV file. It reads data from a CSV file, constructs a doubly linked list dynamically, allows the user to perform various operations, and saves the modified data back to a new CSV file (`new2.csv`).

## Features
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Efficiently manages memory for the doubly linked list.
- **CSV File Parsing**: Reads the CSV file and converts its contents into a doubly linked list.
- **Operations on Linked List**:
  - Insert new data
  - Edit existing data
  - Delete records
  - Sort the linked list by specific columns
  - Search for data in a specific column
- **Save to CSV**: After modifications, saves the updated list to `new2.csv`.

## Files
- `main.c`: Main file that handles reading the CSV, performing operations, and saving results.
- `new2.csv`: Output file that stores the updated list.
- `input.csv`: Sample input file with the original data.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- C compiler (e.g., GCC,devc++)
- A CSV file named `input.csv` in the same directory as the executable or path.

### Example Usage
```
Enter your choice:
1. Insert record
2. Find and delete/edit
3. Sort
4. Fisplay
5. Save 
6. exit
```

## CSV File Structure
The input CSV file should have the following structure:
```
ID,Name,Age,Occupation
1,John,28,Engineer
2,Sarah,31,Doctor
...
```

## Memory Management
The program dynamically allocates memory for each node of the doubly linked list and ensures proper memory deallocation when records are deleted or the program terminates.

## Video Demonstration
A video tutorial on how to use the program is available [here](#) (add a link to your video).
